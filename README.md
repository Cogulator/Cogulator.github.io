Cogulator
=========

A Cognitive Modeling Calculator


Cogulator, a portmanteau of Cognitive and Calculator, is a simple tool for task analysis and GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection Rules) modeling. It's designed to be approachable for new users and quick for experienced ones. To that end, Cogulator has a fairly limited feature set. You describe the task using CMN-GOMS (discussed more later) and Cogulator returns task time predictions and working memory load estimates. Anything that gets in the way of those basic tasks has been eliminated. In fact, even the “S” in GOMS isn’t spared - there are no selection rules available in Cogulator. In short, we have tried to create a tightly focused application for building GOMS models by applying basic human factors to a basic human factors tool.
